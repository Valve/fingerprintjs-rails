  </h3>
Fast browser fingerprint library. Written in pure JavaScript, no dependencies. 
By default uses [Murmur hashing][murmur] and returns a 32bit integer number.
Hashing function can be easily replaced.
Feather weight: only **843** bytes when gzipped.

## What is fingerprinting?

Fingerprinting is a technique, outlined in [the research by Electronic Frontier Foundation][research], of
anonymously identifying a web browser with accuracy of up to 94%. 


Browser is queried its agent string, screen resolution and color depth, 
installed plugins with supported mime types, timezone offset and other capabilities, 
such as local storage and session storage. Then these values are passed through a hashing function
to produce a fingerprint that gives weak guarantees of uniqueness.

No cookies are stored to identify a browser.

It's worth noting that a mobile share of browsers is much more uniform, so fingerprinting should be used
only as a supplementary identifying mechanism there.

### Installation

Add this to your Gemfile
`
gem 'fingerprintjs-rails'
`
and 

`bundle install`

After that you can add the file to sprockets:

`
//= require fingerprint
`

### Usage

```javascript
var fingerprint = new Fingerprint().get();
```

Using custom hashing function

``` javascript
var hasher = new function(value, seed){ return value.length % seed; }
var fingerprint = new Fingerprint(hasher).get();
```
